Commercial cleaning is all about contracts. The "money" isn't in cleaning one house; it's in securing a 12-month contract to clean a 5-story office block.

To sell a £3k+ website to a cleaning company, we need to show them that this site will help them win Corporate Tenders.

The Persona: "The Corporate Hygiene Partner"
The tone here isn't "friendly mop bucket." It is clinical, reliable, and invisible. Office managers don't want "personality" from their cleaners; they want compliance, consistency, and zero headaches.

Here is the homepage copy for Pristine Commercial (or whatever brand name fits the demo).

1. Hero Section (The Promise)
The image you uploaded is perfect. Let's lock in that text as it's very strong.

Headline: Elevating Standards in Commercial Hygiene

Sub-headline: Creating pristine workspaces for productive teams. We provide reliable, high-specification cleaning for offices, clinics, and commercial premises.

Trust Signals (The Bottom Bar):

98% Client Retention: We don't just win contracts; we keep them.

Eco-Certified: Sustainable, non-toxic products for a healthier workplace.

ISO 9001 Accredited: Internationally recognized quality management.

2. The "Pain Point" Section (Why switch cleaners?)
This addresses the #1 fear of office managers: unreliable cleaners who miss spots or don't show up. We position this company as the "Set and Forget" solution.

Headline: Cleaning That You Never Have to Manage

Body: Your facilities team has better things to do than chase cleaners. We operate with military precision, using digital attendance tracking and rigorous quality audits. We turn up, we execute, and we let you get on with business.

Bullet Points:

Guaranteed Cover: Sickness or holiday? We have a standby team ready to deploy, so you never miss a service.

Security Vetted: Every staff member is DBS checked, uniformed, and trained in site security protocols.

Out of Hours: We work around your schedule—late nights or early mornings—to ensure zero disruption.

3. Sector Expertise (The High-Value Contracts)
We need to show they can handle sensitive environments, not just empty bins.

Headline: Specialist Hygiene for Every Sector

Corporate Offices: Create a first impression that lasts. From boardrooms to breakrooms, we maintain a spotless environment that boosts employee morale and impresses clients.

Medical & Clinical (CQC Standards): Infection control is critical. Our teams are trained in CQC-compliant cleaning protocols to prevent cross-contamination in surgeries and clinics.

Education & Schools: Safe, non-toxic cleaning for learning environments. We work during term breaks and evenings to ensure schools are safe for students.

4. The "Tech" Section (Selling YOUR Web Service)
This is the "closer" for your web dev pitch. You are offering them a "Client Portal" feature.

Headline: Total Transparency with Our Client Portal

Body: Forget paper logbooks that get lost. We use smart technology to keep you informed.

Real-Time Audits: Our supervisors upload photo-verified reports directly to your portal.

Digital Checklists: See exactly what was cleaned and when.

Instant Communication: Request extra supplies or report an issue with one click.

(Pitching tip: Tell the cleaner, "This feature lets you bid for government contracts that require digital audit trails.")

5. Testimonials (The Corporate Decision Makers)
These need to sound like busy professionals.

Headline: The Silent Partner Behind Successful Businesses

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "We haven't had a single missed shift in 3 years." "After struggling with three different agencies, this team was a breath of fresh air. The transition was smooth, the staff are polite, and the monthly audit reports make my job incredibly easy." — Sarah Jenkins, Facilities Director, FinTech Solutions

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "They understand clinical standards." "Our dental practice requires strict hygiene compliance. The team is knowledgeable about infection control and consistently passes our internal CQC mock inspections." — Dr. A. Patel, Practice Manager

6. Call to Action (The Tender/Quote)
Commercial cleaning is often about a "Walkthrough" or "Proposal," not just a price list.

Headline: Is your current cleaning provider missing the mark? Body: Let’s discuss a bespoke cleaning schedule that improves standards and reduces costs. Button: [ Request a Site Audit & Proposal ]
